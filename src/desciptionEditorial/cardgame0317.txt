You are playing a game with a deck of r red cards and b blue cards. You are also given p red tokens and r+b-p blue tokens. (0 ≤ p ≤ r+b).

You will now play a game with r+b turns. On the i-th turn, you choose one of your tokens, then choose a random card from the deck uniformly at random. You earn a point if the color of the token matches the color of the card. Otherwise, your score doesn’t change. Afterwards, both the token and the card will get discarded.

Compute the expected value of your score, assuming you play optimally. Note, it is allowed to adjust your strategy based on how many red or blue cards you have seen in previous turns.

Input
The first line of input will contain an integer T, the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case will contain three space separated integers r, b, p.

Output
For each test case, output a single floating point value, the expected score you will get assuming you play optimally in a new line. Your answer will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most 10-6.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ r, b ≤ 100,000
0 ≤ p ≤ r+b

Explanation
For the first case, we have three red cards, one blue card, two red tokens, and two blue tokens. An optimal strategy is to choose the red token first. There are two cases. Either the card we choose first is red or blue. If it is blue, then we know for sure all remaining cards will be red, so it doesn't matter how we play the remaining tokens. This gives us 1 point. If it is red, then we will next play our last red token. We can check that the expected value of our score is equal to 2, and there is no other strategy that is strictly better.

PROBLEM:
Find the expected value of an optimal strategy for a game involving cards and tokens.

QUICK EXPLANATION:
The main observation is that all strategies are optimal strategies; all strategies will lead to the same expected value.

EXPLANATION:
Using the observation above, we get a really simple solution. Let's play all red tokens, then all blue tokens. By linearity of expectation, we can get the total expectation to be
p∗(r/(r+b))+(r+b−p)∗(b/(r+b)).

Intuitively, you can guess this by noticing that the cards are played randomly. We can prove this more formally with induction.

Consider a O(rbp) dp solution as follows. Let f(r,b,p) denote the expected value given we have r red cards, b blue cards, p red tokens, and r+b-p red tokens.

We claim that f(r,b,p)=p∗(r/(r+b))+(r+b−p)∗(b/(r+b))=(p∗r+(r+b−p)∗b)/(r+b)
. We prove this by inducting on r+b.

We can check that the base cases f(1,0,1), f(0,1,1), f(1,0,0) and f(1,0,1) all make sense (i.e. f(1,0,1) = 1, since we have a red token and red card, so we get 1 point).

Now, for the inductive case, consider two cases: we either play a red token or blue token.

Play a red token:
f(r,b,p)=(f(r−1,b,p−1)+1)∗(r/(r+b))+(f(r,b−1,p−1))∗(b/(r+b))
=(((((p−1)(r−1)+(r+b−p)∗b)/(r+b−1)+1)∗r+((p−1)∗r+(r+b−p)∗(b−1))/(r+b−1))∗b)/(r+b)
This is a bit hard to simplify, but we can use wolfram alpha here.

Thus, we get =(p∗r+(r+b−p)∗b)/(r+b)

Play a blue token:
f(r,b,p)=(f(r−1,b,p))∗(r/(r+b))+(f(r,b−1,p)+1)∗(b/(r+b))
=((((p(r−1)+(r+b−p−1)∗b)/(r+b−1))∗r+(((p∗r+(r+b−p−1)∗(b−1))/(r+b−1))+1)∗b)/(r+b)
This can be simplified with wolfram alpha again here.

Thus, we get =(p∗r+(r+b−p)∗b)/(r+b).

Thus, in both cases, we get the same expected value, so this completes the induction step. Thus, we've proven this formula works.
